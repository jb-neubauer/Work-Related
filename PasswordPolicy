If you forget your password or username, notify your manager so IT can reset it for you.  Never give your 
password out to anyone, since it is used to identify you on the network.  Visible passwords will be 
removed by Managers or the IT department.

If someone asks for the password to a shared account, refer them to the appropriate manager or to IT who 
will review the request.  If approval is given, pass the individual(s) the password either verbally or on paper, 
never electronically.

If you have any questions, contact your manager and they can submit an IT ticket as needed.
