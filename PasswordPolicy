Password Policy

*Purpose
To outline the procedure for setting and using passwords for organizational systems.
**Policy**
On your first day, you will be given a password that will allow you to log into your organizational systems.  
***Passwords should:***
	a. Contain a minimum of 8 characters long
	b. Be a non-dictionary word (GHaoiffahsd)
	c. Use look alike characters (O and 0)
	d. Feature a mix of Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters (Th1sl$@p@s$W0rD)
	e. Not be a pattern or have multiple repeating characters (12345678, aaabbbccc, a1a1a1a1a1)
	f. Not be all one type of character (fhdfgfdis, 2749824, #&$&$&@, HAFIAFH)
	g. Not be posted in clear view
	h. Avoid using family names, pets names
	j. Be changed after a predetermined amount of time
	k. Not be used multiple times

If you forget your password or username, notify your manager so they can notify IT.  Never give your 
password out to anyone, since it is used to identify you on the network.  Visible passwords will be 
removed by Managers or the IT department.

If someone asks for the password to a shared account, refer them to management or IT who will review the 
request.  If approval is given, pass the individual(s) the password either verbally or on paper, never 
electronically.
